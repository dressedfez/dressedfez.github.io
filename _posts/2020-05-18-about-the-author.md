Hello reader! I'm Frank. Iâ€™m a Physics PhD with a passion for open source and Linux. I'm interested in topics such as DevOps, machine learning and artificial intelligence .

Furthermore I'm interested in adult education with an emphasis on mathematics, physics and computer science.

In addition to my job and hobby project I like to spend a fair amount of time with my family.
